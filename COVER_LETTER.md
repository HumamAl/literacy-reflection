A literacy reflection tool that handles voice transcription, AI-powered skill tagging, and FERPA-compliant data — that's a focused MVP with clear technical challenges.

**Here's a working demo:** {VERCEL_URL}

The demo shows the full teacher workflow: student roster management, feedback entry with voice/typed input, AI classification of literacy skills and Bloom's taxonomy levels, and a dashboard with real-time analytics. The architecture uses a service layer so Google Classroom and Schoology integrations plug in cleanly later.

Similar systems I've shipped: an AI classification pipeline using OpenAI structured output (WMF Agent), a CRUD-heavy SaaS dashboard (Fleet Maintenance), and Stripe subscription billing (Creator Platform) — all in the Next.js stack.

Happy to walk through the demo on a quick call.
